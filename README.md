![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=Sign+Language+Recognition+using+LSTM)  
*An AI-powered sign language recognition system using LSTM, trained on video datasets, and deployed via a Streamlit app.*

---

## 📜 Overview

This project is a **Sign Language Recognition System** that leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to recognize sign language gestures from video data. The model is trained on a video dataset and deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit web application**. The app also integrates a **speech-to-text** feature and allows users to upload videos for real-time prediction.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **LSTM Model**: A deep learning model trained on video datasets to recognize sign language gestures.
- **Streamlit App**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the model.
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Converts spoken language into text for enhanced accessibility.
- **Video Upload Option**: Users can upload videos for real-time sign language recognition.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The app provides instant predictions for uploaded videos or live input.

## � Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratham-asthana/MADHYAM

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The LSTM model is designed to process sequential video data and extract spatiotemporal features. Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. **Input Layer** 🎥: Accepts video frames as input.
2. **Preprocessing** 🛠️: Frames are resized, normalized, and converted to grayscale.
3. **LSTM Layers** 🔄: Multiple LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies.
4. **Dense Layers** 🧩: Fully connected layers for classification.
5. **Output Layer** 🎯: Softmax activation for gesture prediction.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a **video dataset** containing sign language gestures. The dataset includes:
- 📂 Multiple sign language gestures.
- 🌞 Diverse lighting conditions and backgrounds.
- ⏩ Variations in gesture speed and execution.

*Note: If you're using a custom dataset, ensure it is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.*

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Here are some ideas to make the project even better:

- **Expand Dataset** 📈: Include more gestures and diverse signers to improve model robustness.
- **Multi-Language Support** 🌍: Add support for multiple sign languages.
- **Model Optimization** ⚙️: Experiment with other architectures like Transformers or 3D CNNs.
- **User Feedback Integration** 💬: Allow users to provide feedback on predictions to improve the model.
